      <h2 id="submission-policy">Submission Policy</h2>

<p>The paper submission will be done via <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2022/Workshop/MML">OpenReivew</a>.</p>

<p>Submitted manuscripts must be 8 pages long for full papers, and 4 pages long for short papers. Both full and short papers can have unlimited pages for references and appendices.  We follow ARR submission guidelines. For more information about templates, guidelines, and instructions, see the <a href="https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp">ARR CFP guidelines</a>. We encourage authors to include a broader impact and ethical concerns statement, following <a href="https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp">ARR Ethics Policy</a> from the main conference.</p>

<p>All submissions will be double-blind peer-reviewed (with author names and affiliations removed) by the program committee and judged by their relevance to the workshop themes.</p>

<p>Please note that at least one of the authors of each accepted paper must register for the workshop and present the paper.</p>

<h2 id="non-archival-option">Non-Archival option</h2>
<p>ACL workshops are traditionally archival. To allow dual submission of work, we are also including a non-archival track. If accepted, these submissions will still participate and present their work in the workshop. A reference to the paper will be hosted on the workshop website (if desired), but will not be included in the official proceedings. Please submit through OpenReview but indicate that this is a cross-submission at the bottom of the submission form. You can also skip this step and inform us of your non-archival preference after the reviews.</p>

<h2 id="shared-task-submission">Shared Task Submission</h2>

<p>We will organize a shared task. Papers describing systems that participate in the shared task are welcome to submit to this workshop. Please see the details in a separate call later.</p>
